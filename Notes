Simulating physics in python wiht pygame and pymunk

Pymunk - is a 2D Physics library

1. When using pymunk you must first create a space. A space is where physics is being calculated.
    - We can create physical objects but the first thing we need is a Body
    - Body - an atom that is affected by physics.
    - Body does not have a shape, meaning that it can accept physics but It cannot collide with anything.
    - You can give the Body a shape allowing to collide with other objects.
    - Shape - an area around the body that can collide.

Physical Bodies in pymunk

Static Body - A body that doesnt move but other bodies can collide with it.
Dynamic Body - A body that can be moved by physics.
Kinematic Body - A body that can be moved by the player (or other non-physical code)

Dynamic Body Three Arguements
- Mass (weight)
- Intertia (resistance to movement)
- body_type (what body type we want)

NOTE - pygame expects integers not floats !
